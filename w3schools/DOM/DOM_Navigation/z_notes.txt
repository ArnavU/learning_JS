--> DOM Nodes
According to the W3C HTML DOM standard, everything in an HTML document is a node:

The entire document is a document node
Every HTML element is an element node
The text inside HTML elements are text nodes
Every HTML attribute is an attribute node (deprecated)


--> Navigating Between Nodes
You can use the following node properties to navigate between nodes with JavaScript:

parentNode
childNodes[nodenumber]
firstChild
lastChild
nextSibling
previousSibling


--> The nodeName Property
The nodeName property specifies the name of a node. nodeName is read-only

nodeName of an element node is the same as the tag name
nodeName of an attribute node is the attribute name
nodeName of a text node is always #text
nodeName of the document node is always #document

Note:nodeName always contains the uppercase tag name of an HTML element.


--> The nodeValue Property.
The nodeValue property specifies the value of a node.

nodeValue for element nodes is null
nodeValue for text nodes is the text itself
nodeValue for attribute nodes is the attribute value
